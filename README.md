# MyFlixAngularClient

This is the second client-side version for the API I built as part of my CareerFoundry Web Development curriculum, only this time built with Angular and Typescript. The previous version built with React lives [here](https://movie-api-client.netlify.app/) and the repo for it is [here](https://github.com/Filip-Sazdov/movie_api-client).
